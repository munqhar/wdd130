      <h3>Math Tutoring </h3>
      <p>
        [This site will be a tool for university students and school students,
         We will show the solutions to many math problems in areas like calculus linear algebra statistics geometry, and more, we want to give solutions to math problems with pdf files
          and videos explaining the solution of every problem, Also we want to offer a service as tutoring or courses where student can reinforce their studies, we have seen that many
           students are struggling with topics related to math, so the idea is to let them public exercise in order to resolve them, so we want to create like a forum where others can 
           public their solutions and people can vote if the solution is right, They could find and complete their homework and if they do not understand they could ask for a service,
            They should register in the website for getting all the information, All the information will be free that is the reason people would want to get inside of the website and .
            they will have a coupon to a free service.
            The content would be:

Linear Algebra
This mathematical discipline offers
a convenient language for modeling processes with a certain degree of complexity in a simple way
from their own language and relationships, as well as for the understanding of more mathematical relationships
advanced such as those of analysis, functional analysis, differential geometry and others
1. Sistemas de Ecuaciones Lineales. 
2. Espacios Vectoriales. 
3. Transformaciones lineales. 
4. Valores y vectores propios de una matriz cuadrada.
Geometry:
The teaching of Geometry aims to develop the reasoning capacity and the faculty of abstraction. Its logical rigor and its methods applied to different phenomena and aspects of reality must go hand in hand with observation and experimentation to promote learning. The development of observation, intuition, creativity, and logical reasoning, along with student activities, are basic principles on which mathematical doing is built.
1. in geometric theory, Difference is the concept of undefined terms, definitions, postulates, and theorems.
2. Points, lines, and planes.
3. Angles and triangles.
4. Quadrilaterals.
5. Postulates and theorems.
6. Congruences
7. Geometric Inequalities
8. Straight lines and parallel planes. Lines and perpendicular planes
9. Polygonal regions and their areas.
10. Similarity.
11. Circumferences and spheres.
12. Areas of circles and sectors.
13. Solids and their volumes.
